# 10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt
# and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each
# of the messages. You can pull the hour out from
# the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string
# a second time using a colon.
# From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
# Once you have accumulated the
# counts for each hour, print out the counts,
# sorted by hour as shown below.

# Summarize the changes:
# * Use a dictionary comprehension to construct hours_distribution
# * Use a list comprehension to construct hour_list
# * Use a dictionary comprehension to get hour and count from hour_list
