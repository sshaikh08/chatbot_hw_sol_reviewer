Sure! Here's an optimized solution to the problem as described in its description:

```python
# 10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt
# and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each
# of the messages. You can pull the hour out from
# the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string
# a second time using a colon.
# From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008
# Once you have accumulated the
# counts for each hour, print out the counts,
# sorted by hour as shown below.

# Summary of changes:
# - Use a dictionary to store the counts for each hour, instead of a list.
# - Use the `get()` method to increment the count for each hour, instead of using an if-statement.
# - Use the `sorted()` function to sort the dictionary by hour, instead of creating a separate list of tuples.

times_emails_sent = list()

# Try-except block to handle file not found error
while True:
    try:
        # Prompt the user for a text file
        file_name = input('Please enter a text file: ')

        # If the user enters an empty string, use the default file name
        if len(file_name) < 1:
            file_name = 'mbox-short.txt'

        # Open the file and read the lines
        with open(file_name) as file_handle:
            for line in file_handle:

                # Check if the line starts with 'From' and has more than 2 words
                if line.startswith('From') and (len(line.split()) > 2):

                    # Extract the time email sent from the line
                    time_email_sent = line.rstrip().split()[-2:-1][0]

                    # Append the time email sent to the list
                    times_emails_sent.append(time_email_sent)

        # Break out of the loop if the file was found
        break

    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Print an error message if the file was not found
        print('The file you entered does not exist. Please enter a valid file name.')

# Create a dictionary to store the counts for each hour
hours_distribution = dict()

# Iterate through the list of times emails sent
for instance in times_emails_sent:

    # Extract the hour from the time email sent
    hour_min_sec = instance.split(':')
    hour = hour_min_sec[0]

    # Increment the count for the hour in the dictionary
    hours_distribution[hour] = hours_distribution.get(hour, 0) + 1

# Sort the dictionary by hour
hour_list = sorted(hours_distribution.items())

# Print the counts for each hour
for hour, count in hour_list:
    print(hour, count)
